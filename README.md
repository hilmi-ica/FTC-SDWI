# Resilient Control on Subsea Seawater Injection System

This repository contains simulations for faulted cascade pump on the subsea seawater injeciton system using proposed hierarchical resilient control (HRC) framework (supervisory RTO, stochastic offset-free NMPC, and nonlinear observer), supporting our submission to the IFAC World Congress.

## Purpose

Sharing MATLAB code and data for reproducing results and facilitating review.

## Repository Structure

* **`PumpHRC.m`**: MATLAB simulation code for HRC framework of the cascade pump system.
* **`FeedDist.mat`**: Sequential data to accompany `PumpHRC.m`.

## Requirement

* [Matlab Optimization Toolbox](https://se.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html)
* [YALMIP: A Toolbox for Modeling and Optimization in MATLAB](https://yalmip.github.io)
* [Gurobi Optimization](https://www.gurobi.com)

## IFAC World Congress

This repository directly supports data and code for our paper submission.
